# TTS Daily Read

This repository is a collection of my daily readings on Text-to-Speech (TTS) research papers.  
Each entry records essential keywords, a short TL;DR, and a concise summary.  
The primary goal is to maintain a consistent reading habit and build a reference log for future research.

## Format

Each paper is summarized using the following structure:

- **Keywords**: Core concepts and techniques
- **TL;DR**: A one- or two-sentence takeaway
- **Summary**: Key contributions and methods
- **Notes** (optional): Personal reflections or open questions

## Goal

The objective of this repository is to record and reflect on one paper per day.  
The focus is not on exhaustive reviews, but rather on capturing the essence of each work in a structured and accessible format.
