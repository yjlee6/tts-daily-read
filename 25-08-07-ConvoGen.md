# ConvoGen: Enhancing Conversational AI with Synthetic Data: A Multi-Agent Approach
Date: 2025-08-07 

**Keywords**: Synthetic conversational data, multi-agent systems, persona agents, iterative few-shot sampling, AutoGen, MTLD, LLM-as-a-judge

**TL;DR**: ConvoGen uses persona-driven multi-agent interactions with iterative few-shot sampling to create diverse, grounded synthetic dialogues for training conversational AI.

**Summary**:
- Multi-agent AutoGen framework with persona agents to simulate conversations.

- Iterative few-shot sampling updates prompts with newly generated examples to boost diversity.

- Outperforms human datasets in lexical diversity (MTLD) and grounding (LLM-as-a-judge).

- Scalable for open-domain and potentially domain-specific dialogue generation.

**Notes**:

- High lexical variety may risk unnaturalness.

- Safety filtering remains important.

**Future work**: domain adaptation, style control, human-LLM evaluation alignment.
