**Keywords**: Speech-LLM, synthetic dialogue, paralinguistic cues, voice cloning, batch synthesis

**TL;DR**: End-to-end toolkit for generating natural, expressive synthetic speech dialogues, matching human quality at lower cost.

**Summary**:
- Pipeline: metadata → scripted dialogues → paralinguistic enrichment → voice-cloned synthesis
- Features: interactive sample inspection, high-throughput batch generation
- Results: Comparable to human-recorded quality; released with English/Chinese datasets and open-source code

Notes:
- Paralinguistic modeling is a key differentiator
- Potential to extend to more languages and domains
